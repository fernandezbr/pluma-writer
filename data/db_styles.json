Consistent with the Republic Act (R.A.)

The data stored in the QR code should match the\ninformation printed on the face of the ID to validate the identity of the registered person\nand the authenticity of the card.\nUnder BSP Memorandum Nos. M-2021-057 and M-2022-044, BSFIs are directed to\ninclude the PhilID/printed ePhilID and/or other recognized formats, in the list of valid IDs\ndisplayed on their counters and the public entrance of their establishments, as well as on\ntheir official websites, social media pages, and other consumer information channels.\nBSFIs are enjoined to place the PhilID and ePhilID, being the official government-issued\nID, on the top of the list of acceptable valid IDs to be displayed in conspicuous places\nwithin their premises and be featured in their consumer information channels and/or\npromotional materials.
